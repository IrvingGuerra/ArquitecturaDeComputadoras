@W: MT529 :"c:\users\jorge castillo\documents\escom\5\arquitectura\rom00\div00.vhdl":20:4:20:5|Found inferred clock osc00|osc_int_inferred_clock which controls 25 sequential elements including RO00.OS01.sdiv[23:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
