@W: MT529 :"c:\users\jorge castillo\documents\escom\5\arquitectura\2\practicas\lcd00_renglon\div00.vhdl":20:4:20:5|Found inferred clock osc00|OSC_INT_inferred_clock which controls 25 sequential elements including L00.D01.sdiv[23:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
